The above photo depicts 2,000 possibilities for an investment over 100 time units. If we zoom out farther to 100,000 time units, one can observe that the paths all eventually converge to a single value.

But when looking at a portion of the graph, the paths differ significantly. When applied to stocks, perhaps this communicates the volitility over time. When looking at a smaller portion of the graph, one can observe all the possibilities for the stock price. Using this information, it might even be possible to calculate the probability of a positive return!
