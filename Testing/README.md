## Data
(Explination of Data: Include subject, size, variables ect...)

(Importance of data: Include the goal of the project and its real world aplications).
## Benchmark 
(Explain any similar projects that already exist, as well as ways they differ from your project)
Existing projects include: 
- [MCMC Simulation/MCTS](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-Big-Data-and-Application/blob/main/scripts/R/2021Summer/day_3.R)
	- MCMC randomly calculates paths that stock price could follow
	- MCTS uses past data to tune the parameters used in the MCMC simulation
		- parameters: mean, standard deviation
	- Once the parameters create simulated data that is similar to past data, they can be used to make predictions
- [Sentiment Analysis of Newspapers](https://github.com/dineshdaultani/StockPredictions)
	- Uses past stock data and newspaper articles
	- Sentiment of articles analysized using Natural Language Toolkit package (NLTK)
	- Stock prices and sentiment used as explanatory variables for neural network, stock prediction is the response variable
- [Sample3](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets)

## Proposed Model/Algorithm

(Create a diagram to demonstrate how the project code works)
